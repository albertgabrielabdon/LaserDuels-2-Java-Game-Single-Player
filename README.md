A fun little recreation of my old LaserDuels project, redesigned and improved for solo play.

## Overview

In **LaserDuels-2**, your goal is to **survive for 2 minutes** without losing all your HP. Avoid fireballs and falling into lava to keep your health up 
(you're a penguin here btw)!

- **Background music** uses Cynthia's theme. Happy flashbacks!
- **Gameplay:** The platform size dwindles over time while the number of fireballs increases!
