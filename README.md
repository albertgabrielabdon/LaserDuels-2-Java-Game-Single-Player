A fun little recreation of my old LaserDuels project, redesigned and improved for solo play.

---

## Overview

In **LaserDuels-2**, your goal is to **survive for 2 minutes** without losing all your HP. Avoid fireballs and falling into lava to keep your health up 
(you're a penguin here btw)!

- **Background music** uses Cynthia's theme. Happy flashbacks!
- **Gameplay:** The platform size dwindles over time while the number of fireballs increases!

---

## What's New (May 2025 Update)

- **Lava rises** after 50 seconds — be ready to move fast or be consumed!
- **Flying mobs** now appear:
  - They **attack you** for **20 HP**
  - Their attacks apply **status effects**: weak jump and slowed movement
- **Lava dragon** emerges:
  - It deals a massive **100 damage**
  - It appears from the lava and **weakens you**

 ---

## How to Win

- Survive **2 minutes** without your HP dropping to zero.
- Avoid all hazards:
  - **Fireball hit:** -10 HP
  - **Flying mob hit:** -20 HP + debuffs (weaker jump, slower speed)

  - **Dragon hit:** -100 HP + weakened state
- **Punch fireballs** by clicking on them within your range to destroy them and prevent damage.
