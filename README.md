A fun little recreation of my old LaserDuels project, redesigned and improved for solo play.

---

## Overview

In **LaserDuels-2**, your goal is to **survive for 2 minutes** without losing all your HP. Avoid fireballs and falling into lava to keep your health up 
(you're a penguin here btw)!

- **Background music** uses Cynthia's theme. Happy flashbacks!
- **Gameplay:** The platform size dwindles over time while the number of fireballs increases!
- **Lava rises** after 50 seconds!

## How to Win

- Survive **2 minutes** without your HP dropping to zero.
- Avoid all hazards:
  - **Fireball hit:** -10 HP + knockback
  - **Flying mob hit:** -20 HP + debuffs (weaker jump, slower speed)
  - **Lava hit:** -50 HP
  - **Dragon hit:** -100 HP + weakened state
- **Punch fireballs** by clicking on them within your range to destroy them and prevent damage.
- **Punch flying mob** by clicking on them 3 times (three taps to kill).
